<p style="text-align:justify;">
Hi, my name is Nate Curry and I began my OSCPÂ journey several years ago. My first legitimate exposure to hacking <span class="emoji">ðŸ’»</span>, outside of using Metasploit to send a MS08_netapi payload at a host running SMB on port 445, was through someone I met on reddit. I was soon shown the ropes and introduced to the "Mount Kilimanjaro" of hacking: The <b><a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/">OSCP</a></b>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Having started hacking with virtually <b>NO Linux exposure</b>, I endured a lot of "pain" and "sufferance" as it took a long time for me to learn enough to defeat the OSCP exam! Now, that I stand at the top of the mountain I (figuratively speaking) wish to throw the rope to the rest of you all on the climb and speak about my transition into pentesting!</p>

<p>As of Sept 2018 I am now a full time pentester!</p>
