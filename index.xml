      <description>Self Dox: Hi, my name is Nate Curry and I began my OSCP¬†journey several years ago. My first legitimate exposure to hacking üíª, outside of using Metasploit to send a MS08_netapi payload at a host running SMB on port 445, was through someone I met on reddit. I was soon shown the ropes and introduced to the &amp;ldquo;Mount Kilimanjaro&amp;rdquo;of hacking: The OSCP.
Having started hacking with virtually no Linux exposure, caused me a lot of &amp;ldquo;pain&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;sufferance&amp;rdquo;and it took a long time for me to learn enough to defeat the OSCP exam!</description>

I hate reading boring articles so I&amp;rsquo;m not going to waste any of your time by writing one. Besides, you&amp;rsquo;re probably an PWK student with lab time ticking away each second as you get closer to your exam date; The very exam date that will determine whether or not you&amp;rsquo;ve become a man/woman yet in the information security industry. Right now, you&amp;rsquo;re still a little boy/girl with absolutely nothing going for yourself.</description>
