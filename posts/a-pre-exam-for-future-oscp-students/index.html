<p><h2>Overview</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whether you are in preparation for your lab time to begin or you just want to get a feel for what exam day will be like, I&rsquo;ve put together a few practice exams for future OSCP students to take. These boxes should be comprehensive enough to cover many of the basics that you will face in the labs. All of these boxes will have write-ups available for you to review <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>AFTER</strong></span> your exam time has ended. It is imperative that you do not read these during your practice exam <strong>(no matter what)</strong> because this will completely destroy all of the mental elements of the exam that you will need to overcome. If you find yourself stuck and the feeling of helplessness starts to creep in, you&rsquo;re doing it right!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the exam I encourage you to read the write-ups to see if there are other attack vectors that you missed and to review any boxes that you were unable to compromise. Learn from your mistakes and retry. At the end of this exam, whether you pass or fail, you will have gained knowledge that will be applicable during your lab time and have had an experience that will prepare you mentally for the exam.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#3366ff;"><span style="color:#e36a62;">TLDR&rsquo;ers Start hereÂ </span> </span></strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Schedule a set time for when you would like your 24 hour period to begin</li>
    <li>Follow the OSCP guidelines <a href="https://support.offensive-security.com/#!oscp-exam-guide.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> on Metasploit usage and other rules you will encounter on the actual exam to best replicate the real conditions</li>
    <li>The boxes have points associated to each on a scale of 1-10. The passing score will be 7 out of 10 points
<ul>
    <li><strong>YOU WILL NOT NEED METASPLOIT ON THIS PRACTICE EXAM </strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">As you boot the machines <strong>resist the temptation of watching them boot</strong> as some of the Vulnhub machines in this practice exam reveal which boxes they are during the boot-up sequences as well as on the login screens</span></li>
    <li>Do not read the text file named &ldquo;Box Names&rdquo; until you are ready to read the write-ups for each machine
<ul>
    <li>The &ldquo;Box_Names.txt&rdquo; file will reveal which practice machine correlates to which Vulhub machine</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>This practice exam is very easy to cheat on but try your best not give yourself hints for your own sake</li>
    <li>Once you are finished, feel free to do a write-up on your own and post it to your own blogs
<ul>
    <li>Feel free to link it in the comments</li>
