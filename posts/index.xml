      <description>GoDaddy GUI Stuff üôà So in my first post I didn&#39;t show how I had all the DNS things set up in GoDaddy. One thing I always get hung up on is adding the TXT record for Let&#39;s encrypt. I always find a way to mess up the TXT record somehow. This is how it should look when you&#39;re waiting for the DNS registrar to update your Let&#39;s Encrypt TXT record:</description>

      <description>So I was recently on an internal assessment (Thanks Hexcartel) and got to do some cool tricks I felt like sharing. Behold some tricks:
Dumping Lsass on Windows 10 üòã Quick and Easy  So, we all know you can&#39;t just blast Crackmapexec and attach a C2 stager and get shells raining like you could in an unpatched Windows 7 network. See my post on &#34;How I use Koadic on Internals&#34;</description>

      <description>Storytime&amp;hellip; üéß So this one&#39;s gonna be short and sweet; More of a lesson than anything. So, for those of you that don&#39;t follow me super close, I recently went on a trip to Cancun Mexico; It was great in case you were wondering. Anywho, one of those days I noticed this huge kiosk that happened to be a 40 inch Flatscreen Touchscreen TV that listed the hotel&#39;s special services and was there for public use.</description>

      <description>Installing Postfix First thing you need to do to get started is install postfix on your jump box.
‚ãä&amp;gt; /e/gophish sudo apt-get install postfix  Once you have it installed you&#39;ll need to configure the main.cf file. After making changes to your main.cf file make sure that the service actually runs. If you run the postfix service with sudo service postfix start do a quick netstat and see if you see port 25 open and listening.</description>

      <title>How to Use Silent Trinity - Bresaola 0.3.0dev</title>

      <description>Overview ‚òî Yea.....so apparently there is very little documentation for the current build of Silent Trinity. I was in the office today and saw my boy TheTalilama figuring it out so I decided to hop in and see how it worked. It actually does a great job against Windows 10 from what I have seen from just fooling around with it. Let&#39;s get into how it works.

      <description>Backstory üìñ So...there was this one location in Vegas during Defcon 27 that had these pcs that could be used by the general public. Kiosks as some would say...Well I went over to them to see what all accessibility these kiosks had to offer out of general curiosity, you know, &#34;can these let me access facebook, github, reddit&#34; etc. type stuff. Well, to my astonishment these kiosks had an interface that wouldn&#39;t allow me to access the C:\ drive!</description>

      <description>Intro There&#39;s a lot of hype around the new version of Covenant 3.0 so I figured I&#39;d share my installation experience with the world (I need content...shhhhh...lol). My boy Wraith said it was pretty legit so I had a quick look-see before hoping into bed. It def looks like a solid and modern framework that ups that ante for other C2 frameworks (you&#39;ll never steal my heart from Koadic!‚ù§).</description>

      <description>Overview I LOVE KOADIC!! Yes this doesn&#39;t work out of the box against Windows 10+ machines but if you find yourself on a network with older Windows 7 and Windows Server 2012 and below machines Koadic will gobble the network whole and very quickly. I guess I should note that much of what I love about it is it&#39;s organization and implementation of Mimikatz which is probably the real MVP of the tool.</description>

      <title>What It&#39;s Like Being a Pentester After OSCP</title>

      <description>Job Hunting? Go Away&amp;hellip;.üò§ So after you become an OSCP you expect jobs to just start raining on you after you stamp that OSCP in your resume and start sending it out. Yea....no. If you&#39;re like me and all you have is OSCP and Hackthebox in terms of network security experience job hunting can be absolutely excruciating. The interviews process can make you feel like you know absolutely nothing; which is partially true if you were like me at the time.</description>

      <description>body { text-align: justify}  Backstory One day I was on site with client and was tasked with assessing an application for them. This was troubling for two reasons: 1.) This was my first on site assessment and 2.) due to the nature of the content I was tasked to work with, my little visit there required full supervision, which meant that my primary point of contact (POC) watched over my shoulder as I worked on this application for about 4 or so hours.</description>

      <title>LazySysAdmin Writeup</title>

      <guid>/posts/lazysysadmin-writeup/</guid>
      <description>Intro I chose to do this write-up on LazySysAdmin because it is a good box for potential OSCP students to start out on and something that every OSCP pentester and every current OSCP (PWK) student that is ready to take the exam should be able to do without using a walk-through. This box should take 6 hours or less if you do not experience any hang ups or interruptions.</description>

      <description>Overview Whether you are in preparation for your lab time to begin or you just want to get a feel for what exam day will be like, I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a few practice exams for future OSCP students to take. These boxes should be comprehensive enough to cover many of the basics that you will face in the labs. All of these boxes will have write-ups available for you to review AFTER your exam time has ended.</description>

I hate reading boring articles so I&amp;rsquo;m not going to waste any of your time by writing one. Besides, you&amp;rsquo;re probably an PWK student with lab time ticking away each second as you get closer to your exam date; The very exam date that will determine whether or not you&amp;rsquo;ve become a man/woman yet in the information security industry. Right now, you&amp;rsquo;re still a little boy/girl with absolutely nothing going for yourself.</description>
