<p style="text-align:justify;">
So...there was this one location in Vegas during Defcon 27 that had these pcs that could be used by the general public. Kiosks as some would say...Well I went over to them to see what all accessibility these kiosks had to offer out of general curiosity, you know, "can these let me access facebook, github, reddit" etc. type stuff. Well, to my astonishment these kiosks had an interface that wouldn't allow me to access the c:\ drive! Well this was a problem because I had just downloaded an image of beef off of the internet that I needed to print! So after a while of poking around I was able to find a sufficient work around in case you all ever need to print pictures of beef on a locked down Kiosk!</p>

<h3 id="the-hac-i-mean-workaround-part-tldrers-start-here">The Hac..I mean, Workaround Part    &ndash;TLDRers Start here ⤵</h3>

<p>So, when you approach the Kiosk this is what you see; and in case you&rsquo;re wondering, that windows key isn&rsquo;t a part of the Windows OS:</p>

</center></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
So on these machines a lot of the shortcuts were disabled. I later discovered that alt+tab and exiting the kiosks application worked but that's beside the point! Much of what I tried failed in terms of shortcut keys. After you log in to the machine as the guest user it allows you to access what many would consider the best internet browser of the modern age: Microsoft Edge (lol).</p>

<p><b>The interesting thing about this is that when you try to access the file system on Windows using Edge it actually opens the directory using Windows Explorer. </b></p>

<p>Doing this actually bypassed the whatever weird policy this particular location had in place at the time:</p>

</center></p>

<p>If I wanted to actually use Windows Explorer to access the c:\ drive the policy would disallow the attempt:</p>

<figcaption>

</center></p>

<p>Even &ldquo;worthless&rdquo; Chrome would obey the machines policy and block access to the file system&rsquo;s C:\ drive!</p>

<figcaption>

</figure>
</center></p>

<p>Now, this also worked in Firefox but it wasn&rsquo;t as sexy. Firefox didn&rsquo;t use Windows Explorer, it used it&rsquo;s browser&rsquo;s ftp like directory browser functionality. For demonstration I did this locally:</p>

<p><center>

</center></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
The last thing to note from trying to print my picture of beef was that the machine wouldn't let me use the start menu at all. Well using "Win+k" then "Win+x" allowed me to pop the start menu and bypass the shortcut key restrictions in place. This allowed me to do things like reboot the machine which restored the Kiosks main sandbox application and access other things that Windows Explorer wasn't offering just in case I needed to configure the printer settings etc. etc..</p>

</center></p>

<p>In checking out my options I also noticed that these machines didn&rsquo;t block access to the bios and allowed users to boot to USB and configure all the things:</p>
