So this one's gonna be short and sweet; More of a lesson than anything. So, for those of you that don't follow me super close, I recently went on a trip to Cancun Mexico; It was great in case you were wondering. Anywho, one of those days I noticed this huge kiosk that happened to be a 40 inch Flatscreen Touchscreen TV that listed the hotel's special services and was there for public use. This was great because I just so happened to be looking for a good spa service at the time so I ended up taking a look at this ting to see what they had available.

<h3 id="generosity">Generosity ðŸŽ </h3>

<div align="justify"><p>
To my surprise simply touching the display panel revealed the Windows 10 taskbar! At this point I looked towards the security guard who happened to be right next to me as I used this kiosk and said in horrible Spanish, "Internetico?" which isn't how you say "Internet" in Spanish; Yea... He took a look and said "Si, perro no download." Sounded good to me! My new amigo, who happened to yell at me earlier that night for doing Jiu-Jitsu on the beach after hours, just let me use this 40 inch TV for Internet as long as I didn't download anything! This was great because I also needed to check some internetty things out as well. Kiosks are so convenient aren't they!?

<div align="justify"><p>
So after hopping on this thing I realized had a bit of a slow connection so I needed to do an IP config to see if I had an IP address so I opened the terminal up as administrator and low and behold, the kiosk was running with SYSTEM level privs! A bit overkill for simply checking out spa treatments and things on the internet I'll admit but I appreciate the hospitality!
</p></div>

<h3 id="lessons">Lessons ðŸŽ’</h3>

<div align="justify"><p>
Lessons learned, sometimes kiosks in the wild are already ready and willing to give you SYSTEM/ROOT. In this circumstance I was on vacation which meant NO WORK but it was good to know that this hotel was hospitable enough to give users SYSTEM out of the box, no questions asked. For this, they definitely will be getting a 5 star rating from me! Another thing that's pretty noteworthy is that sometimes using a 40 inch flatscreen tv for general internet usage late a night in the middle of the lobby <i>isn't</i> sketchy to some people. I mean I guess it shouldn't be since I wasn't really doing anything but it would definitely catch my eye if I saw someone playing with something like this. lol
